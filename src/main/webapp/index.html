			<h5>Tuition Reimbursement Management System</h5>
		</header>

		<p>We provide a system that encourages quality knowledge growth
			relevant to an individual's expertise. Currently, TRMS provides
			reimbursements for university courses, seminars, certification
			preparation classes, certifications, and technical training. The
			current system relies solely on email communication, requiring manual
			lookups of available funds and is error-prone due to inbox clutter
			and incorrect routing of tasks. Furthermore, there is no way to
			record and report on reimbursements awarded, and so the company has
			no way to identify highly-invested courses that could be developed to
			be offered in-house.</p>
